Fill out a Brand Use Request Form Previous Tab Logos, Icons and Colors Partners and Advertisers Entertainment and Media API and Device Partners Next Tab The YouTube Logo Download Full-Color Light Logo Download Full-Color Dark Logo Download Monochrome Logos Using the YouTube Logo Safe Space The YouTube Logo always needs safe space that is free of imagery and text surrounding it. Use half the Icon’s width to determine the minimum amount of safe space that should surround the Logo. If copy appears below the Logo, you should measure safe space from the bottom of the Logo to the x-height of the text. Minimum size The word "YouTube" should always be easy to read. So in digital content the Logo should never appear smaller than 24dp in height. The minimum size for applying the Logo in print is 0.125 in/3.1 mm in height. Minimum digital height: 24dp Minimum print height: 0.125in or 3.1mm What not to do with the Logo The YouTube Logo is a symbol people recognize, so it should never be altered. Here are a few examples of what not to do with the YouTube Logo. Don’t Change the spacing between the icon and the word "YouTube" or its letters Use any colors other than red, almost black, or white Choose a different typeface for "YouTube" Add visual effects like a drop shadow Change or replace the word "YouTube" in any way Change the shape of the Logo Use the Logo in a phrase or sentence Using the Logo on solid backgrounds These examples show the correct application of the YouTube Logo on different solid backgrounds. The almost black full-color Logo should be used on a background that’s lighter than 40% gray. The white full-color Logo should be used on a background that’s darker than 50% gray. Full-color Logo There are two versions of the full-color Logo, almost black and white – but the triangle in the Icon should always be white. Use the almost black full-color Logo on a light background. Use the white full-color Logo on a dark background. Monochrome Logo If a background color makes the full-color Logo hard to see, you should use a monochrome Logo instead. The almost black (#282828) monochrome Logo contains a white triangle in the Icon. It should be used on light multi-colored images. The white (#FFFFFF) monochrome Logo has a no-fill triangle. It should be used on dark multi-colored images. The YouTube Icon Download Full-color Icon Download Light Icon Download Dark Icon Using the YouTube Icon Our Icon Our Icon is a flexible mark that works as a call to action and a shorter version of our Logo. If you don't have enough room to use the Logo at 24dp with the correct amount of safe space, you should use the YouTube Icon instead. Safe space Like the Logo, our Icon also needs empty space around it. To determine the right safe space, just use half of the Icon’s width. Minimum size The Icon should always be big enough to see clearly. So in digital content it should never appear smaller than 24dp in height. The minimum size for applying the Icon in print is 0.125 in/3.1 mm in height. Minimum digital height: 24dp Minimum print height: 0.125in or 3.1mm What not to do with the Icon The YouTube Icon should never be altered. Here are a few examples of what not to do with the Icon. Don’t Stretch the Icon's shape horizontally or vertically Change the triangle's angles or size Use colors other than red, almost black, or white Rotate the Icon Add any special effects Add a pattern or image to the Icon Replace the triangle with other shapes or icons Replace the triangle with words Choose a new shape for the rectangle Using the Icon in social media The YouTube Icon can only be used in social media assets when it links to a YouTube channel. Important: The only time a Logo or Icon can be made a link is when the destination URL is a YouTube channel.

Fill out a Brand Use Request Form Partners and Advertisers You want to promote your YouTube channel or content, and we want to help. You’re welcome to use the YouTube name, Logo and Icon as long as you adhere to the Logo and Icon usage guidelines, as well as those found below. Do Get every use of any YouTube brand element approved by YouTube Follow all guidelines for the YouTube brand Avoid repetitive use of the YouTube Logo in channel art Ensure Logos in use are up to date Use the YouTube Icon within a social Icon lineup Use the standard Logo to promote your channel or content when linking or driving traffic to your channel Don’t Use Logos or brand elements to drive to sites outside of YouTube Modify Logos, Icons, or other brand elements in any way, including but not limited to altering proportions, positions, stretching, condensing, changing color or typefaces, flipping or rotating, or adding effects Place the full-color Logo on red (due to lack of visibility) Partially cover the Logo or Icon Place an image within the Logo or Icon Here are some good and bad examples of using YouTube branding: When using YouTube inline with other social media icons, it’s best to use the YouTube Icon rather than the YouTube Logo. Do Don’t Correct YouTube Logo & Icon Please double check to make sure you're using the correct, updated YouTube Logo and not an unofficial or old Logo (there are lots out there). The latest Logos can be downloaded here. Do Don’t The standard Logo should not be placed on a red background due to a lack of visibility. The white monochrome Logo works best on red. Do Don’t The full-color Logo should not be used in channel art because it's redundant with the YouTube Logo that exists on the website. Do Don’t Third party approvals You’re responsible for getting third-party approvals from relevant content owners for any content you upload to YouTube that doesn't belong to you.

YouTube reserves the right to remove any content from the site that may violate its Terms of Use or Community Guidelines. Using the word "YouTuber" Guidelines for creators We love that so many creators like to call themselves YouTubers. We just ask that “YouTuber?? or “Tuber?? is only used when talking about a person creating and uploading original video or music content to YouTube. We also want to keep "YouTuber" casual. That way everyone can use it. So please don’t use “YouTuber?? or “Tuber?? in official names of things like video series, books, and programs, or register domains, channel names, or trademarks that include those words. This’ll help us protect the YouTube trademark for the whole creator community. Guidelines for advertisers “YouTuber?? should only be used when referring to a person that creates and uploads original video or music content to YouTube. It’s not ok to call people that only upload content to other video platforms "YouTubers.?? So that we can be sure "YouTuber" is only used in a casual way, we ask that third parties not use “YouTuber?? in official names of things like video series, books, and programs, or seek to register domains, channel names, or trademarks that include those words. This’ll help protect the YouTube trademark for us and for the community. While “Tuber?? can be used by YouTube creators informally, it should never be used by advertisers.
