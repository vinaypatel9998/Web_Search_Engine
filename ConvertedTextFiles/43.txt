Something went wrong. Tap to Retry. Troubleshoot internet and device connection You may be able to play your YouTube videos again by following the steps below for internet and device connections. Internet speed The quality of your home or cell-phone network can affect how smoothly YouTube videos play, and whether videos play in HD.  The table below shows the approximate speeds recommended to play each video format. The actual speed that your device receives may vary from the number you see when you run an 'Internet speed test.' This is due to factors including WiFi performance, time of day, and how your ISP connects to YouTube. If there are multiple devices on your network, then the connection is shared between them which may reduce the speed that your device receives.
