YouTube Premium is a paid membership that gives you an enhanced, uninterrupted experience across YouTube, YouTube Music, and YouTube Gaming. YouTube Premium benefits: • Ad-free videos: Watch videos without interruptions • Save offline: Save videos and songs on your mobile device to watch offline • Background play: Keep videos or music playing when using other apps or when your screen’s off • Audio mode: Listen to audio only on the YouTube Music app • Google Play Music Subscription (when available in your country) is included at no additional cost YouTube Premium benefits won’t work on YouTube videos that you pay to view, such as paid channels, movie rentals, and pay-per-view purchases. Learn more about paid content on YouTube. YouTube Premium is available for mobile phones, tablets, desktop computers, and TVs. Some benefits are compatible only with certain devices (details about each benefit below). Are rentals, purchases, or paid channel subscriptions included with YouTube Premium? Your YouTube Premium membership does not include access to any content that requires purchase, such as rentals, pay-per-view purchases, or paid channel subscriptions. How do ad-free videos work? With YouTube Premium, you can watch millions of videos without ads. Videos on YouTube Premium won’t include pre-roll or mid-roll video ads, banner ads, search ads, homepage banner ads, and in-video text-overlay-ads. You may still see incidental branding or promotions embedded in creators' content that isn't controlled by YouTube. Ad-free videos are supported across all devices and platforms where you can sign in with your YouTube account. How does saving offline work? • YouTube app: Save videos or playlists to watch offline when you aren’t connected — on the road, at the gym, or on your next camping trip. • YouTube Music app: Set a storage limit and audio-only settings, and the app will save a personalized selection of music. The number of video or audio files you can save depends on your mobile device’s amount of free space and storage capacity, as well as the size and quality of the saved videos. You can adjust the maximum amount of space to use for offline content and see the amount of space currently used by saved files. Videos will remain offline for up to 30 days. Some content may not be available offline when you reconnect to the internet due to content restrictions from video creators. Saving videos offline is available only on the YouTube Android and iOS mobile apps on supported smartphones. How does background play work? Background play allows your video to keep playing in the background, uninterrupted, even when you open other apps or turn the screen off on your mobile device. Background play is available only on the YouTube Android and iOS mobile apps on supported smartphones. How does audio mode work (YouTube Music app only)? Stream only the audio while using audio mode in the YouTube Music app. You can turn this mode on or off to switch between audio only or both audio and video. Audio mode is available only in the YouTube Music app. Which YouTube Originals are included? To see the original movies and series included with a YouTube Premium membership, visit this channel. Availability of specific videos may change based on time, the device/app being used and geographic location. How does the included Google Play Music subscription work? As an added bonus, your YouTube Premium membership includes (when available in your country) a free subscription to Google Play Music, with access to its extensive catalog of music. If you’re already a Google Play Music subscriber, you’ll receive a free Music Premium membership. You can watch videos, get recommendations, and see your recent activity in both products. If you cancel your Google Play Music subscription, you’ll lose access to Music Premium and will no longer qualify for a free Music Premium trial. What if I want to cancel my membership? You can cancel your YouTube Premium membership at any time. Refunds and credits aren't issued for partial billing periods. Learn more about the refund policy. Have other questions?
